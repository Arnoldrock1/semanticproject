        <b>About Basketball</b>
        <article>
          <p>
            Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular
            court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter)
            through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at
            each end of the court), while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth
            two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the
            player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with
            the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of
            play (overtime) is mandated.

        <b>About Boxing</b>
        <article>
          <p>
            Boxing[b] is a combat sport and martial art.[1] Taking place in a boxing ring, it involves two people – usually wearing
            protective equipment, such as protective gloves, hand wraps, and mouthguards – throwing punches at each other for a
            predetermined amount of time.
            
            Although the term "boxing" is commonly attributed to western boxing, in which only fists are involved, it has developed
            in different ways in different geographical areas and cultures of the World. In global terms, "boxing" today is also a
            set of combat sports focused on striking, in which two opponents face each other in a fight using at least their fists,
            and possibly involving other actions, such as kicks, elbow strikes, knee strikes, and headbutts, depending on the rules.
            Some of these variants are the bare-knuckle boxing, kickboxing, Muay Thai, Lethwei, savate, and sanda.[2][3] Boxing
            techniques have been incorporated into many martial arts, military systems, and other combat sports.
